### tone_PY & JS

This example shows how to play tones on a Piezo Speaker using PWM signals. A Piezo is nothing but an electronic device that can both be used to play tones and to detect tones. 

#### circuit
![WeIO Fritzing analogRead](images/tone_PY&JS.png)
In our example we are plugging the Piezo on the pin number 23, that supports the functionality of writing a PWM signal to it, and not just a plain HIGH or LOW value.
<br></br>
Piezos have polarity, commercial devices are usually having a red and a black wires indicating how to plug it to the board. To build the circuit connect the black one to ground (GND) and the red one to the output (pin 23) with a 100-ohm-resistor.

#### code: tone_PY

In the program below, the only thing that you do will in the **setup()** function is to attach **myTone** function to main process with the command:

``` python
attach.process(myTone)
```
 
Next, in **myTone** function, you need to initialisse **freq** variable that will be the frequency of first played tone:

``` python
freq = 16
```

Then create an infinite loop for play tones every 100 milliseconds with this commands:

``` python
while True:

	...
	
	delay(100)
```

Finally, inside of this loop you need to play tone, increment **freq** variable and print value of current played tone. You can do this with the commands **tone(pin,freq)**, **print** and **delay(ms)**. You can add some text to your printed string to make it more showy (use commas to concat strings):

``` python
tone(23, freq) 
freq = freq+1
print "Frequency = ", freq , "Hz"
```

Now, when you run the code you should see in the IDE Monitor a steady stream of numbers ranging from 16 to the infinite, correlating to the tone played by the piezo speaker: 

```python
from weioLib.weio import * 

def setup():
    # attaches myTone function to infinite loop
    attach.process(myTone)
    
def myTone():
    # init variable freq
    freq = 16
    # create infinite loop
    while True:
        # get tone with "freq" frequency on pin 23
        tone(23, freq)
        # increment freq variable
        freq = freq+1
        # print frequency on the console
        print "Frequency = ", freq , "Hz"
        # wait 100ms
        delay(100)
```

#### code: tone_JS


In the program below the visible page content, the body, contains only a paragraph with id **"phrase"**. This paragraph will be used to display current frequency and call **hertzs()** function by cliking:

``` html
<p id="phrase" onclick="hertzs()"></p>
```

First you need to define what to do when page is loaded and websocket opened with this command:   

``` javascript
function onWeioReady() { ... }
```

In this example you need to call the main function to initialise displayed phrase. This fucntion update displayed phrase and set the **hertz** variable to play tones: 

``` javascript
hertzs();
```

Then you need to create **hertz** variable and set initial frequency to play, in this case 0Hz:

``` javascript
var hertz = 0;
```

In the main function displayed text and played tone are updated with this commands:

``` javascript
$("#phrase").html("FREQUENCY FOR TONE FUNCTION = "+ hertz);
tone(23, hertz);
```

Finally you need to increment **hertz** variable and reset at 18000:

``` javascript
hertz = hertz+50;
if(hertz > 18000){
	hertz=0;
}
```

Now when you open the web user interface you should see a text that is frequency value off PWM on the **pin 23**. By cliking on this text you can increment this frequency and play corresponding tone on the piezo speaker:

```html

    	}
    
    	// init variable hertz
    	var hertz = 0;
    
    	function hertzs() {
        	// update displayed phrase with variable hertz
        	$("#phrase").html("FREQUENCY FOR TONE FUNCTION = "+ hertz);
        	// get tone with "hertz" frequency on pin 23
        	tone(23, hertz);
        	// increment hertz variable
        	hertz = hertz+50;
        	// Reset hertz variable at 18000
        	if(hertz > 18000){
            	hertz=0;
        	}
    	}
    </script>

Analog
------

### analogRead_PY & JS
This examples shows you how to read analog input from the physical world using a potentiometer. A potentiometer is a simple mechanical device that provides a varying amount of resistance when its shaft is turned. By passing voltage through a potentiometer and into an analog input on your WeIO, it is possible to measure the amount of resistance produced by a potentiometer as an analog value. In this examples you will monitor the state of your potentiometer using IDE console (python example) and web user interface (html/JS example). 

#### Circuit
![WeIO Fritzing analogRead](images/analogRead_JS&PY.png)
Connect the three wires from the potentiometer to your WeIO board. The first goes to ground from one of the outer pins of the potentiometer. The second goes from 3.3 volts to the other outer pin of the potentiometer. The third goes from analog input 31 to the middle pin of the potentiometer.
<br></br>
By turning the shaft of the potentiometer, you change the amount of resistance on either side of the wiper which is connected to the center pin of the potentiometer.
<br></br>
This changes the voltage at the center pin. When the resistance between the center and the side connected to 3.3 volts is close to zero (and the resistance on the other side is close to 10 kilohms), the voltage at the center pin nears 3.3 volts. When the resistances are reversed, the voltage at the center pin nears 0 volts, or ground. This voltage is the analog voltage that you're reading as an input.
<br></br>
The WeIO has a circuit inside called an analog-to-digital converter that reads this changing voltage and converts it to a number between 0 and 1023. When the shaft is turned all the way in one direction, there are 0 volts going to the pin, and the input value is 0. When the shaft is turned all the way in the opposite direction, there are 3.3 volts going to the pin and the input value is 1023. In between, **analogRead()** returns a number between 0 and 1023 that is proportional to the amount of voltage being applied to the pin. 

#### Code: analogRead_PY
In the program below, the only thing that you do will in the **setup()** function is to attach myProcess function to main process with the command:

``` python
attach.process(myProcess)
```
 
Next, in **myProcess** function, you need to initialize **pin** variable that will be the number of your analog input:

``` python
pin = 31
```

Then create an infinite loop for read analog input every 100 milliseconds with this commands:

``` python
while True:

	...
	
	delay(100)
```

Finally, you need to print the analog value to your monitor. You can do this with the commands **print**, **annalogRead(pin)** and **delay(ms)**. You can also add some text to your printed string to make it more showy (use commas to concat strings):

``` python
print "analogRead pin ",pin," = ",analogRead(pin)
```

Now, when you run the code you should see in the IDE Monitor a steady stream of numbers ranging from 0-1023, correlating to the position of the pot. As you turn your potentiometer, these numbers will respond almost instantly. 

``` python
from weioLib.weio import *

def setup():
	attach.process(myProcess)

def myProcess():	
	pin = 31
	while True:
		print "analogRead pin ",pin," = ",analogRead(pin)
		delay(100)
```

#### Code: analogRead_JS

##### User interface: index.html
In the program below the visible page content, the body, contains only a paragraph with id **"phrase"**. This paragraph will be used to display the potentiometer value:

``` html
<p id="phrase" ></p>
```

To update this value you need to use JavaScript and JQuery functions. You can define what to do when page is loaded and websocket opened whit this function:

``` javascript
function onWeioReady() { ... }
```

In this example you need to set a timer every 100 milliseconds: 

``` javascript
setInterval(function() { ... }, 100);
```

To read the potentiometer value every 100 milliseconds you need to call analogRead() function.

``` javascript
analogRead(31,pinCallback);
```

This functins works like in python but needs an extra parameter, the callback function, that is received message from IDE server to user interface. This callback contains analog value an pin number.

``` javascript
function pinCallback(data) { ... }
```

Using Jquery you can update paragraph text:

``` javascript
$("#phrase").html("ANALOGREAD VALUE ON THE PIN 31 IS "+ data.data);
```

Now when you open the web user interface you should see a new phrase every 100 millisenconds with potentiometer value.
 
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head >
    <script data-main="www/libs/weioLibs" src="www/libs/require.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="myStyle.css">
    <script>
        function onWeioReady() {
            // Do something every 100ms
            setInterval(function() {
            //pinCallback will be called when data arrives from server
            analogRead(31,pinCallback);
            }, 100);
        }
        
        function pinCallback(data) {
            // update displayed phrase
            $("#phrase").html("ANALOGREAD VALUE ON THE PIN 31 IS "+ data.data);
        }
    </script>
</head>

### blink_PY
This example shows the simplest thing you can do with a WeIO to see physical output: it blinks an RGB LED on board.

#### Circuit
![WeIO Fritzing blink](images/blink_PY.png)
WeIO have an RGB LED attached to pins 18, 19 and 20 on the board itself. If you run this example with no hardware attached, you should see that LED blink.
<br></br>
To build the circuit with an RGB LED, attach 220-ohm resistor to long leg and connect it to ground. Then attach pins 18, 19 and 20 to red, gren and blue legs, respectively.
<br></br>
Now when you run your code you should see that board LED plus external LED blink.

  
#### Code
In the program below, the first thing you do is to attach **blinky()** function to main process with the command:

``` python
attach.process(blinky)
```

In the **blinky()** function, you create an infinite loop to change the state of the pins:

``` python
while True:
```

You turn the LED on with the command:

``` python
digitalWrite(18, HIGH)
```

This supplies **3.3 volts** to **pin 18**. That creates a voltage difference across the pins of the LED, and lights it up. Then you turn it off with the command:

``` python
digitalWrite(18, LOW)
```

That takes **pin 18** back to **0 volts**, and turns the LED off. 

In between the on and the off, you want enough time for a person to see the change, so the **delay()** commands tell the WeIO to do nothing for **100 milliseconds**.


```python
from weioLib.weio import *

def setup():
    # Attaches blinky function to infinite loop
    attach.process(blinky)

def blinky():
    while True:
        # write HIGH value to digital PINS 18, 19 & 20
        digitalWrite(18, HIGH) # red led
        digitalWrite(19, HIGH) # green led
        digitalWrite(20, HIGH) # blue led
        # wait 100ms
        delay(100)
        # write LOW value to digital PINS 18, 19 & 20
        digitalWrite(18, LOW) # red led
        digitalWrite(19, LOW) # green led
        digitalWrite(20, LOW) # blue led
        # wait 100ms
        delay(100)
```	

###  digitalWrite_JS
This example shows the simplest thing you can do with a WeIO to do physical actions from user interface: it turns on and off an RGB LED on board by touching or cliking your screen.

#### Circuit
![WeIO Fritzing analogRead](images/blink_PY.png)
WeIO have an RGB LED attached to **pins 18, 19 and 20** on the board itself. If you run this example with no hardware attached, you should see that LED turn on or off.
<br></br>
To build the circuit with an RGB LED, attach 220-ohm resistor to long leg and connect it to ground. Then attach **pins 18, 19 and 20** to red, gren and blue legs, respectively.
<br></br>
Now when you run your code and go to web user interface you should control the state of that board LED plus external LED.


#### Code
In the program below the visible page content, the body, contains only a paragraph with id **"phrase"**. This paragraph will be used to display current pins values and call **lights()** function by cliking:

``` html
<p id="phrase" onclick="lights()"></p>
```

First you need to create **light** variable and set initial state of pin, in this case false (**LOW** state):

``` javascript
var light = false;
```

Then you need to define what to do when page is loaded and websocket opened inside of this function:

``` javascript
function onWeioReady() { ... }
```

In this example you need to call the main function to initialise displayed phrase. This fucntion test the **light** variable, update displayed phrase and write **HIGH** if **light** variable is true and **LOW** if **light** variable is false: 

``` javascript
function lights() { ... };
```

You turn the RGB LED on or off with the lines:

``` javascript 
digitalWrite(18, LOW); or digitalWrite(18, HIGH);
digitalWrite(19, LOW); or digitalWrite(19, HIGH);
digitalWrite(20, LOW); or digitalWrite(20, HIGH);
```

Using Jquery you can update paragraph text, background color and font color:

``` javascript 
$("#phrase").html("TURN OFF THE LIGHT!");
$("body").css("background","white");
$("#phrase").css("color","black");
```

Finally you need to tooggle **light** variable with this line:

``` javascript
light = !light;
```

Now when you open the web user interface you should see a text that is digital value on the **pins 18, 19 and 20**. By cliking on this text you can change the state of your pins and lights on or off the RGB LED.

``` html

		        digitalWrite(19, LOW);
		        digitalWrite(20, LOW);
		        // toggle light variable
		        light = !light;
		    } else {
		        // Change displayed phrase, background and font color.
		        $("#phrase").html("TURN ON THE LIGHT!");
		        $("body").css("background", "black");
		        $("#phrase").css("color", "white");
		        // write HIGH on pins
		        digitalWrite(18, HIGH);
		        digitalWrite(19, HIGH);
		        digitalWrite(20, HIGH);
		        // toggle light variable
		        light = !light;
		    }
		}
	</script>
</head>

<body>
    <p id="phrase" onclick="lights()"></p>
</body>

</html>
```

##### Custom CSS style: myStyle.css
This simple CSS shows you how to stylize your user interface:
 
``` css
p {
	cursor:pointer;
	margin:0.2em;
	line-height:1em;
	font-family:Helvetica;
	font-size:200px;
	font-weight:bold;
}
```

### pinMode_PY
This example shows you how to set input mode for digitalRead purpose. Using **IDE console** you will monitor the state of two push-buttons connected to ground and **3.3 volts**. 

#### Circuit
![WeIO Fritzing analogRead](images/pinMode_PY.png)
Connect two wires, red and black, from **3.3 volts** and ground pins to the two push-buttons. Then connect orange wire from digital **pin 24** to push-button connected to **3.3 volts** and purple wire from digital **pin 25** to push-button connected to ground pin.
<br></br>
When the push-buttons are open (unpressed) there is no connection between the two legs of the pushbuttons, so the pins are not connected. When the buttons are closed (pressed), it makes a connection between their two legs, connecting the **pin 24** to **3.3 volts** and the **pin 25** to **ground**, so that we read  **HIGH** and  **LOW** values on corresponding pins.
<br></br>
When the push-buttons are open pull-down resistor on the **pin 24** keep the input **LOW** and pull-up resistor on the **pin 25** keep the input **HIGH**.
<br></br>
If you don't set internal pull-up and pull-down resistors the digital value printed in the IDE console could be false. This is because the input is "floating", it will randomly return either **HIGH** or **LOW**. That's why you need a pull-up and pull-down resistor in the circuit. 

#### Code

In the program below, the first thing you do is to attach **buttonLoop** function to main process with the command:

``` python
attach.process(buttonLoop)
```

Next, in **buttonLoop** function, you need to set your input pins and corresponding pin modes with this commands:

``` python
pinDown = 24
pinUp = 25
```

``` python
pinMode(pinDown,PULL_DOWN)
pinMode(pinUp,PULL_UP)
```

In the **buttonLoop** function, you create an infinite loop to read inputs and print values every 500 milliseconds with the command:

``` python
while True:
```

You read the digital value with the command:

``` python
valDown =  digitalRead(pinDown)
```

You print the value on the IDE console with the command:

``` python
print "Pin",pinDown,"state: ",valDown
```

The delay() commands tell the WeIO to do nothing for 100 milliseconds:

``` python
delay(500)
```

Now, when you run the code you should see in the IDE Monitor the digital values of pins 24 and 25, correlating to the state of the push-buttons.  


``` python
from weioLib.weio import *

def setup():
    attach.process(buttonLoop)
    
def buttonLoop():
    # define pins for reading
    pinDown = 24
    pinUp = 25
    # set pin 25 to pull_up mode
    pinMode(pinDown,PULL_DOWN)
    pinMode(pinUp,PULL_UP)
    # create infinite loop
    while True:
        # read digital value on pin 25
        valDown =  digitalRead(pinDown)
        valUp =  digitalRead(pinUp)
        # print result
        print "Pin",pinDown,"state: ",valDown
        print "Pin",pinUp,"state: ",valUp
        print ""
        # wait 500ms
        delay(500)
```

### genericMessageOnOff
This example shows you how to send messages from javascript to python using **genericMessage()** function.

#### circuit 
![WeIO Fritzing analogRead](images/blink_PY.png)
WeIO have an RGB LED attached to **pins 18, 19 and 20** on the board itself. If you run this example with no hardware attached, you should see that LED turn on or off.
<br></br>
To build the circuit with an RGB LED, attach 220-ohm resistor to long leg and connect it to ground. Then attach **pins 18, 19 and 20** to red, gren and blue legs, respectively.
<br></br>
Now when you run your code and go to web user interface you should control the state of that board LED plus external LED.

#### code
In the program below the visible page content, the body, contains two  sections with **div** tag. By cliking on this sections you can send events to python. 

The first one send event **msgFromJStoPy** with message **1**. You can set background color, text and function to call when you click on the section with this command:  

``` html
<div style="background-color:white" 
     onclick='genericMessage("msgFromJStoPy",1)'>             
     CLICK HERE TO SEND EVENT WITH MESSAGE 1 TO PYTHON
</div>
```

The second one send event **"msgFromJStoPy"** with message **0**. You cant set background color, text and function to call when you click with this command:

``` html
<div style="background-color:black" 
     onclick='genericMessage("msgFromJStoPy",0)'>             
     CLICK HERE TO SEND EVENT WITH MESSAGE 0 TO PYTHON        
</div>
```    

Now when you open the web user interface you should see two parts. By cliking on this text you can change the state of your pins and lights on or off the RGB LED.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head >
    <script data-main="www/libs/weioLibs" 
            src="www/libs/require.js"></script>
 	<link href="www/libs/bootstrap-3.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
 	      rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="myStyle.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

<body>
    <div style="background-color:white" 
         onclick='genericMessage("msgFromJStoPy",1)'>             
         CLICK HERE TO SEND EVENT WITH MESSAGE 1 TO PYTHON
    </div>
    <div style="background-color:black" 
         onclick='genericMessage("msgFromJStoPy",0)'>             
         CLICK HERE TO SEND EVENT WITH MESSAGE 0 TO PYTHON        
    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

Then in the python side, the main.py, you need to set function to call when event with name **"msgFromJStoPy"** is cached with this command:

``` python
attach.event("msgFromJStoPy", led)
```

``` python
from weioLib.weio import *

def setup():
    # create event and link to function
    attach.event("msgFromJStoPy", led)

def led(dataIn):
    print "msgFromJStoPy cached, received data:", dataIn
    print " "
    
    # write received data on pins 18, 19 and 20
    digitalWrite(18, dataIn)
    digitalWrite(19, dataIn)
    digitalWrite(20, dataIn)
```

### getTemperature_JS

This example shows you how to read WeIO board temperature and display value on web user interface. WeIO have an LM75 termometer on the board itself, the example run with no hardware attached.

#### code

##### User interface: index.html

In the program below the visible page content, the body, contains only a paragraph with id **"phrase"**. This paragraph will be used to display temperature from board termometer:

``` html
<p id="phrase"  ></p>
```

First you need to define what to do when DOM is fully loaded and websocket to WeIO opened with this command:   
  
``` javascript
function onWeioReady() { ... }
```

In this example you need to set a timer every 200 milliseconds: 

``` javascript
setInterval(function() { ... }, 200);
```

To read the termometer value you need to call getTemperature() function:

``` javascript
getTemperature(pinCallback);
```

The callback function is received message from IDE server to user interface. This callback contains temperature value an pin number. You can choice function and parameter names whatever you want (in this example **pinCallback** and **data**):

``` javascript
function pinCallback(data) { ... }
```

Using Jquery you can update paragraph text:

``` javascript
$("#phrase").html("TEMPERATURE ON THE BOARD IS "+ callback.data);
```

Now when you open the web user interface you should see a new phrase every 200 millisenconds with termometer value.

``` html

### smartphoneGyro

This example shows you how to read smartphone gyroscope, diplay angle values on the user interface and monitor on the IDE console.

#### code
In the program below the visible page content, the body, contains three paragraphs with ids **"alpha"**, **"beta"** and **"gamma"**. This paragraphs will be used to display smartphone gyroscope angles:

``` html
<p id="alpha"></p>
<p id="beta"></p>
<p id="gamma"></p>
```

Now when you open the web user interface you should see three new phrases every 200 millisenconds with gyroscope values.

```html

      	    // sending angles to python
            genericMessage("gyro", gyroAngles);
			
			// Update displayed values
            $("#alpha").html("alpha: "+gyroAngles[0]);
            $("#beta").html("beta: "+gyroAngles[1]);
            $("#gamma").html("gamma: "+gyroAngles[2]);
    	});

    attach.event('gyro', gyroHandler)

def gyroHandler(dataIn):
    # gyroscope angles
    alpha = dataIn[0]
    beta  = dataIn[1]
    gamma = dataIn[2]
    # print gyroscope angles on the console
    print "Gyroscope angles => alpha=",alpha,"beta=",beta,"gamma=",gamma
```

Serial
------

### helloWorld

This example shows how to communicate with other devices using the serial port on board. This example works at 11520 baud rate (11520 8-bit characters per second), set the same configuration in both devices to read and write properly.

#### code

In the program below, the first thing you do is to attach **fadeInOut** and **UART** functions to main process with this commands:

```python
attach.process(fadeInOut)
attach.process(UART)
```

Then you need to define both functions. **fadeInOut** will be only used to shows that the example runs. **UART** will be used for the communication (red and write):

```python
def fadeInOut():
	
	...
	
	
def UART():
	
	...
	
```



```python
from weioLib.weio import *
from weioLib.weioSerial import Serial, listSerials

def setup():
    # making two indipendant processes. One that drives with pwm LEDs
    # another that writes and reads from serial port
    attach.process(fadeInOut)
    attach.process(UART)
    
def fadeInOut():
    # defining infinite loop
    while True:
        # count from 0 to 100 % 
        for i in range(0,100):
            # change PWM duty cycle to i
            pwmWrite(18,i)
            pwmWrite(19,i)
            pwmWrite(20,i)
            
        # count from 0 to 100 % 
        for i in range(0,100):
            # change PWM duty cycle to 100-i
            pwmWrite(18,100-i)
            pwmWrite(19,100-i)
            pwmWrite(20,100-i)

def UART():
    # list available serial ports in WeIO
    print listSerials()
    # open WeIO serial port that is attached to pins 0-RX and 1-TX
    # initSerial function return python serial object (pyserial library)
    # it's defined with (path, baud rate, timeout-optional 1 by default)
    ser = Serial(115200)
    
    i = 0
    while True:
        ser.write(str(i))
        ser.write(" - Hello, World!\r\n")
        i+=1
        # print what comes in
        data = "" #ser.read(1)
        n = ser.inWaiting() #look if there is more 
        if n:                                                                 
            data = data + ser.read(n)#and get as much as possible
            print data
        delay(100)
```

WebApps

### pwmWriteModule_JS

This example shows how to create a simple web application to control the state of PWM outputs in real time from web user interface.

#### circuit

![WeIO Fritzing analogRead](images/pwmWriteModule_JS.png)
To build the circuit connect **pins 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 24** to long leg of six LEDs. Then attach 220-ohm resistor to the short leg of the LEDs and connect it to ground.

#### code

In the program below the visible page content, the body, contains six sections. Each section can be considered like a row divided in two parts, one paragraph to display values and one slider to control PWM outputs. In this example we use **bootstrap twitter library** to create this sections using classes **col-xs-3** (3/12 of device screen) and **col-xs-9** (9/12 of device screen):

```html
<div class="col-xs-3">	    
	...
</div>
<div class="col-xs-9">
	...
</div>
```

Below you can see how to define this sections for **pin 18**. You need to create a paragraph inside of **div col-xs-3** with id **"pin18"** and define displayed text at the start. 

```html
<div class="col-xs-3">	    
	<p id="pin18">PIN 18<br>DUTY CYCLE = 0 %</p>
</div>
```

Then you need to create a **range input** (slider) inside of **div col-xs-9** and define what to do when there is a new value of slider  using parameter **oninput="your function"**. Here we call **pwm()** function with parameters **18** and **this.value** that is the current value of the slider:

```html
<div class="col-xs-9">
	<input type="range" value="0" oninput="pwm(18, this.value, pin18)" />
</div>
```

Once all sections are created (for six inputs) you need to define **pwm()** function:

```javascript
function pwm(pin, value, pinID) { ... }
```

Using Jquery you can update paragraph text. As you see you need the id of the paragraph and the pin number display the right text in the right place:

```javascript
$(pinID).html("PIN "+pin+"<br>DUTY CYCLE = "+value+" %");
```

Finally you need to write the value on corresponding PWM output. Notice that value needs to be parsed as an int:

```javascript
pwmWrite(pin, parseInt(value));
```
	
Now when you open the web user interface you should see six sliders that control PWM output in real time:

```html

    <script>
		// This function display input and set pwm duty cycle
        function pwm(pin, value, pinID) {
            // update displayed phrase
            $(pinID).html("PIN "+pin+"<br>DUTY CYCLE = "+value+" %");
            // set pwm duty cycle
            pwmWrite(pin, parseInt(value));
        }
    </script>

</head>

<body>

### googleUnseenMsg_PY

This example shows how to light on the RGB LED on board when there are unread messages in your google inbox.

#### code

In the program below, the first thing you do is to attach **googleInbox** function to main process with the command:

```python
attach.process(googleInbox)
```

Next, in the **googleInbox** function, you need to set the mail server, your username and your password:

``` python
server   = 'imap.gmail.com'
username = 'USERNAME'
password = 'PASSWORD'
```

Then you need to connect to the port 993 of gmail server with this command:

``` python
account = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(server, 993)
```

You need also to login with this command:

``` python
account.login(username, password)
```

Finally you can select your inbox folder with this command:

``` python
account.select('Inbox')
```

Now you need to create an infinite loop to check inbox every 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) with the commands:

``` python
while True:
	
	...
	
	delay(2000)
```

Inside of this loop you search unseen messages with this command: 

``` python
status, data = account.search(None,'(UNSEEN)')
```

Inside of this loop you search the inbox messages with this command: 

``` python
inbox = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
```

And you convert to JSON format with this command:
```python
jsonData = json.loads(inbox)
```

Then you can easly exctract information from your JSON file with this commands:

```python
messages = jsonData["data"][0]["comments"]["data"]
color = messages[-1]["message"]
```

Finally you test if there are unseen messages in your inbox. If yes you print **"UNSEEN MESSAGES"** in the IDE console and you turn on the red LED, else you turn off the red LED:

``` python
if data[0] :
	print "UNSEEN MESSAGES"
	digitalWrite(18,LOW)
else :
   digitalWrite(18,HIGH)
```

Now, when you run the code you should see the red LED turned on and a message printed on the IDE console if there are unseen messages in your inbox:  

```python
from weioLib.weio import *
import imaplib

def setup():
    attach.process(googleInbox)
    
def googleInbox():
    # define imap server, username and password
    server   = 'imap.gmail.com'
    username = 'USERNAME'
    password = 'PASSWORD'

    # connect to server
    account = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(server, 993)
    # login 
    account.login(username, password)
    # select Inbox folder
    account.select('Inbox')

    # create infinite loop
    while True:
        # search unseen messages
        status, data = account.search(None,'(UNSEEN)')
        # if there are unseen messages lights the red LED
        if data[0] :
            print "UNSEEN MESSAGES"
            digitalWrite(18,LOW)
        else :
            digitalWrite(18,HIGH)
        # wait 2 seconds    
        delay(2000)  
```

### facebook_PY

This example shows how to turn the RGB LED on board in different colors according to received facebook messages. 

#### code

In the program below, the first thing you do is to attach **myProcess** function to main process with the command:

```python
attach.process(myProcess)
```

Next, in the **myProcess** function, you need to set your access token:

``` python
accessToken = "< HERE YOUR ACCESS TOKEN >"
```

Then concat the facebook inbox graph URL with your access token to create **url** variable:

``` python
url = "https://graph.facebook.com/me/inbox?access_token="+accessToken
```

Now you need to create an infinite loop to check inbox every 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) with the commands:

``` python
while True:
	
	...
	
	delay(5000)
```

Inside of this loop you can get received messages in JSON format with this commands: 

```python
inbox = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
jsonData = json.loads(inbox)
```

Then you can search last received message in the JSON with this commands:

```python
messages = jsonData["data"][0]["comments"]["data"]
color = messages[-1]["message"]
```

Finally, chek received message and turn the LED in corresponding color if key is avalaible:

```python
if color == "red":
	digitalWrite(18,LOW)
	digitalWrite(19,HIGH)
	digitalWrite(20,HIGH)
```

To run this example you need to create your facebook application in facebook developers web site: [https://developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com)  
Once you've created your application go to Tools & Support -> Tools / Graph API Explorer -> Get Access token -> Extended Permissions -> select read_mailbox permission and create your access token.
<br></br>
Now, when you run the code you should see the LED turn on different colors and a message printed on the IDE console according to last received message. Available keys are "red", "green" or "blue". All received messages are valids includng messages sended by yourself.

```python
from weioLib.weio import *
import urllib2, json

def setup():
    attach.process(myProcess)

def myProcess():
    
    print("Starting Facebook dialog")
    
    # Your access token 
    accessToken = "< HERE YOUR ACCESS TOKEN >"
    # Inbox url requiring access token
    url = "https://graph.facebook.com/me/inbox?access_token="+accessToken

    # Create infinite loop to check inbox messages
    while True:
        # get inbox data from url
        inbox = urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
        # transform string data in JSON python format
        jsonData = json.loads(inbox)
        # get messages from jsonData
        messages = jsonData["data"][0]["comments"]["data"]
        # get last received message
        color = messages[-1]["message"]

        # print last received message on the console
        print "Last received message: ", color
        
        # write coresponding digital values to pins
        if color == "red":
            digitalWrite(18,LOW)
            digitalWrite(19,HIGH)
            digitalWrite(20,HIGH)
            
        if color == "green":
            digitalWrite(18,HIGH)
            digitalWrite(19,LOW)
            digitalWrite(20,HIGH)
            
        if color == "blue":
            digitalWrite(18,HIGH)
            digitalWrite(19,HIGH)
            digitalWrite(20,LOW)            
         
        # wait 5 seconds ( To not exceed the rate limit of calls)    
        delay(5000)
```
